# NoTeX — Agent Notes

## Project Summary

NoTeX is a Python CLI tool that scans a directory of handwritten lecture note
PDFs, runs them through the Mathpix API for OCR (text, LaTeX, figures), cleans
up the extracted text with an LLM, and writes organized Markdown into an
Obsidian vault. It is run manually by the user, is fully idempotent, and never
modifies its input.

## Critical Invariants

- **`notes_raw/` is a permanent, read-only archive.** The pipeline must never
  write to, move, delete, or otherwise modify any file inside it, under any
  circumstances.
- **`notes_raw/` and `vault/` live outside this repository.** They are sibling
  directories to the repo root, not subdirectories of it. Never assume or
  create `notes_raw/`/`vault/` paths relative to the repo. The actual
  absolute paths for this machine are in `config.yaml` (gitignored, machine-
  specific — see `config.example.yaml` for the template). Read `config.yaml`
  directly from disk when you need the real paths; it's present in the
  working tree even though it isn't tracked in git.
- **The pipeline must be idempotent.** Re-running on unchanged input must be a
  no-op. State tracking (later phases) is the sole mechanism for deciding
  what's already processed.

## Environment

All code — running scripts, tests, and installing packages — happens inside
the `notex` conda environment. Never run Python outside of it.

```
conda activate notex
```

Once activated, `python` resolves to the env's own binary
(`~/miniconda3/envs/notex/bin/python`).

**Package installation must always use `conda install`, never `pip install`.**
This applies to every dependency, no exceptions. Install with:

```
conda activate notex
conda install <package>
```

`conda-forge` and other conda channels are fine when a package isn't on the
default channel (e.g. `conda install -c conda-forge <package>`) — the rule is
"use conda instead of pip," not "defaults channel only." Never fall back to
pip to work around a missing package.

Dependencies are tracked in `environment.yml` (reproduce with
`conda env create -f environment.yml`), not `requirements.txt`.

## Current Phase

**Phase 1 — Core Mathpix pipeline.** Scope: given a single PDF path, submit to
Mathpix, poll to completion, retrieve Markdown + figures, write to `_cache/`.
No discovery loop, no `state.db`, no LLM stage, no vault writing yet — those
arrive in later phases (see full spec discussion for the 7-phase roadmap).

## Mathpix API notes

These correct assumptions in the original planning spec, verified against
current docs.mathpix.com. Follow these, not the original spec's Mathpix
section, when implementing `src/mathpix.py`:

- **Status values:** `received → loaded → split → completed` (or `error`).
  Not `loading → processing → completed`.
- **Upload:** multipart form-data with a `file` field plus an `options_json`
  field (a JSON-encoded string of options) — not a raw PDF binary body.
- **Figures:** request `conversion_formats: {"md.zip": true}` and extract the
  bundle locally. Do not rely on `GET /v3/pdf/{pdf_id}` returning a figure
  asset list (it only returns status/progress fields), and do not rely on
  `cdn.mathpix.com` image URLs staying valid long-term (30-day retention).
- **Figure format:** images inside the zip are `.jpg`. Decision: keep as
  `.jpg` in the vault, no PNG conversion.
- **Math delimiters:** whether Mathpix emits `$...$` or `\(...\)`/`\[...\]`
  by default in `md`/`mmd` output is **unconfirmed**. Verify empirically
  against real API output during the Phase 1 smoke test before building the
  Phase 3 (LLM validation) or Phase 5 (delimiter pass) logic around it.

## Testing Conventions

- **Automated unit tests** (`tests/`) mock all HTTP calls via `respx`. They
  must never hit the real Mathpix API — no network, no cost, safe for CI.
- **Manual smoke tests** (`scripts/`) hit the real Mathpix API against real
  PDFs and cost money per run. They are not part of the `pytest` suite and
  are run manually when validating actual output quality (OCR correctness on
  handwriting can't be asserted automatically).

## Git / Issue Tracking

Issues are tracked on GitHub from the start of the project. Code is being
developed locally and will not be pushed to the `origin` remote until Phase 1
is validated against real Mathpix output.
